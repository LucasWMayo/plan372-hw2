```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

```

Load the data from CSV.

```{r}
data <- read_csv("C:/Users/lucas/Documents/plan372/plan372-hw2/restaurant_inspections.csv")

head(data)
```

Used the head(data) like we commonly do in class in order to ensure that it was loaded correctly.

Question 1. Visualizing distribution of inspection scores

```{r}
ggplot(restaurant_inspections, aes(x= SCORE)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

Here I attempted to utilize what we did in class with line plots and apply it to a histogram. The data mentioned that I should use a better value, as it was originally using 'bins = 30' so I changed it to 100.
